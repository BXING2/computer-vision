## General
This example demonstrates image generations using diffusion models. 

## Dataset
The dataset is CIFAR-10 from Torchvision. It consists of a train subset with 50K images and a test subset with 10K images. The image dimension is 32x32x3. There are 10 classes in the dataset. 80% and 20% train subset are used for training and validation, respectively. The entire test subset is used for evaluating the final model performance.

## Model
The model is PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) which belongs to policy gradient algorithm. It consists of an actor model and critic model. The actor model approximates a policy function for generating the action distributions. The critic model approximates a value function for evaluating the goodness of the selected action given the state. The model is optimized on the clipped surrogate objective function to avoid rapid updates on the parameters. For each iteration, a number of trajectories (a sequence of states and actions) are generated based on the current policy. Using quantities including action probalities, advantages, predicted values and returns, the policy and value model parameters are optimized. The updated policy is used again to generate new trajectories for the optimizetion at the next iteration.

Figure 1 shows the loss at different epoches on the train and validation dataset during training. Figure 2, 3 demonstrates the forward and backward process of the diffusion model. In the forward process, guassian nosies are incrementally added to the original clean images, which eventually turn into pure noises. In the backward process, the noises are gradually removed so that the images transform from pure noises into clean images. Figure 4 illustrates the 100 real images from the original dataset and 100 fake images generated from the diffusion model. Figure 5 shows the dependence of FID score on the number real/fake images used for the calculation. The FID gradually decreases and converges as the number of the images increases. The final FID score on the entire test dataset is 44.
